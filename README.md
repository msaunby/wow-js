Simple Javascript interface to WOW for weather observation upload


Visit http://msaunby.github.io/wow-js to try it.

I'm going to try and stick to Javascript only for this project.  

The server side code is in the directory js. You can either run it on your own server, using nodejs, or intermitently on a connected PC, or perhaps use a service such as OpenShift.

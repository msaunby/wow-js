Simple Javascript interface to WOW for weather observation upload


Visit http://msaunby.github.io/wow-js to try it.

I'm going to try and stick to Javascript only for this project.  

The server side code is in the directory js. You can either run it continuously on your own server, using nodejs, or intermittently on a connected PC, or perhaps use a hosting service such as OpenShift.
